                    Al-Aqsa Mosque, mosque in Jerusalem, located in the Old City at the terminal point 
                    of the Prophet Muhammad’s Isrāʾ journey. According to Islamic sources, the Qurʾān 
                    (17:1) indicates that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from Mecca 
                    (al-masjid al-ḥaram, or “the sacred place of worship”) to this site in Jerusalem 
                    (al-masjid al-aqṣā, “the farther place of worship”). On that spot he led Abraham, 
                    Moses, Jesus, and other messengers (rusul) of God in ritual prayer (ṣalāt). That 
                    same night he was taken up to heaven from the site of the Dome of the Rock for an 
                    encounter with God (see Miʿrāj). The term Al-Aqsa Mosque is often extended to denote 
                    the entirety of the plaza on which the mosque and the Dome of the Rock stand, 
                    although the plaza is known formally as Al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf (“the Noble Sanctuary”).

                    In modern times the mosque and the plaza have become a particular point of tension 
                    in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Apart from its importance to Muslims, the plaza holds 
                    significance for Jews as the site of the Temple of Jerusalem, whose Herodian 
                    incarnation was destroyed in 70 ce. The Temple Mount, as Jews refer to the plaza,
                    and the adjacent Western Wall have since served as a site of pilgrimage. During the 
                    Six-Day War (1967), Israel (state established in 1948) occupied East Jerusalem and 
                    its Old City, which had been part of Jordan. Israel later annexed East Jerusalem, 
                    but the plaza was left under the custodianship of an Islamic trust (waqf) maintained 
                    by the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan. In the following decades, however, restrictions 
                    on Palestinian Muslims’ access to the site, as well as Israeli excavation projects 
                    in the vicinity and evictions of Palestinian residents in nearby neighbourhoods, 
                    contributed to Muslims’ concerns over the holy site’s fate. For more information on 
                    Al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf and its significance, see Dome of the Rock and Temple Mount.
